# SDtoHD_video_Conversion

                                                   Approach
Conversion of Videos From SD to HD Resolution Using Diffusion
My approach to convert an SD video to HD using a pre-trained  Diffusion model from Hugging Face Hub. It details the steps involved, and libraries used, and provides explanations for each step.
1. Understanding the Approach:
•	Stable Diffusion is a powerful image generation model. In this case, we leverage its ability to enhance image details to upscale individual frames from an SD video.
•	The pre-trained model resides on Hugging Face Hub, a platform for sharing and accessing various machine learning models. But before this firstly to generate API token that are used where I used this model .
2. Prerequisites:
•	A Google Colab account or a local machine with Python, libraries installed, and an appropriate GPU.
•	An API token from Hugging Face Hub to access the pre-trained model
3. Libraries Used:
•	OpenCV: For video frame extraction and assembly.
•	Transformers: Library for loading and interacting with Stable Diffusion pipeline.
•	Diffusers: Provides the Stable Diffusion pipeline specifically.
•	PIL (Pillow): Used for image processing tasks like format conversion.
4. Steps Involved:
a. Setting Up the Environment:
1.	Create a New Notebook on Google Colab or use a Python environment locally.
2.	Install Required Libraries: !pip install opencv-python transformers diffusers
b. Setup and Authentication
•	Sign Up and Generate API Token: Create an account on Hugging Face, navigate to your settings, and generate an API token. This token will be used to authenticate and access the pre-trained models
c. Load Pre-Trained Diffusion Model
•	Use the Hugging Face transformers library to load the pre-trained diffusion model.
d.  Upload SD Video and Set Paths
•	Upload SD Video: Upload your SD video to the working environment.
•	Set Paths: Define the input video path, frames extraction folder, upscaled frames folder, and output video path
e. Extract Frames from SD Video
•	Extract frames from the input SD video and save them as images in Frames folder in colab directory

f. Upscale Frames Using the Diffusion Model
•	Use the pre-trained diffusion model to upscale each extracted frame.
g. Combine Upscaled Frames into HD Video
•	Combine the upscaled frames into a single HD video.

Whole Summary
1.	Authentication: Sign up on Hugging Face and generate an API token then use it where I use diffusion model.
2.	Library Installation: Install required libraries : transformers, torch, pillow, opencv-python.
3.	Model Loading: Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using the API token.
4.	Video Processing:
o	Extract frames from the SD video.
o	Upscale each frame using the diffusion model.
o	Combine the upscaled frames into a single HD video.
